## Week 2 Homework

###2.6

If you roll a pair of fair dice, what is the probability of

(a) getting a sum of 1?

P = 0

(b) getting a sum of 5?

P = 4/36

(c) getting a sum of 12?

P = 1/36


###2.8

The American Community Survey is an ongoing survey that provides data every year to give communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The 2010 American Community Survey estimates that 14.6% of Americans live below the poverty line, 20.7% speak a language other than English (foreign language) at home, and 4.2% fall into both categories.

(a) Are living below the poverty line and speaking a foreign language at home disjoint?

No, as 4.2% of people fall into both categories, they are not mutually exclusive.

(b) Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated probabilities.

```{r}
draw.pairwise.venn(20.7, 14.6, 4.2, c("Speak 2nd Lang (20.7%)", "Below Poverty Line (14.6%)"), fill = c("blue", "red"));
```

(c) What percent of Americans live below the poverty line and only speak English at home?

P(Living Below the Poverty Line) = P(Pov) = 14.6%

P(Living Below the Poverty Line AND Speak Second Language at Home) = 4.2%

P(Living Below the Poverty Line AND NOT Speak Second Language at Home) = 14.6% - 4.2% = 10.4%

Answer = 10.4%

(d) What percent of Americans live below the poverty line or speak a foreign language at home?

P(Pov) OR P(Lang) = P(Pov) + P(Lang) - P(Pov AND Lang) = 20.7% + 14.6% - 4.2% = 31.1%

(e) What percent of Americans live above the poverty line and only speak English at home?

P(Above Poverty Line) = 100% - P(Pov) = 100% - 14.6% = 85.4%

P(Only English at Home) = 100% - P(Lang) = 100% - 20.7% = 79.3%

P(Above Poverty Line AND Only English at Home) = 85.4% * 79.3% = 67.7222%

Answer = 67.7222%

(f) Is the event that someone lives below the poverty line independent of the event that the person speaks a foreign language at home?

Yes, knowing one does not help us determine the value of the other.


###2.20

Assortative mating is a nonrandom mating pattern where individuals with similar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than what would be expected under a random mating pattern. Researchers studying this topic collected data on eye colors of 204 Scandinavian men and their female partners. The table below summarizes the results. For simplicity, we only include heterosexual relationships in this exercis.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/mike/Documents/R/win-library/3.5/DATA606/labs/Lab1/question2.20.PNG")

```

(a) What is the probability that a randomly chosen male respondent or his partner has blue eyes?

P(Partner Blue) + P(Self Blue) - P(Partner Blue AND Self Blue) = 108/204 + 114/204 - 78/204 = 144/204


(b) What is the probability that a randomly chosen male respondent with blue eyes has a partner with blue eyes?

P(Partner Blue Eyes|Self Blue Eyes) = P(PBE|SBE) = P(PBE) * P(SBE|PBE)/P(SBE) = 

```{r}
(78/204)/(114/204)

```

0.684

(c) What is the probability that a randomly chosen male respondent with brown eyes has a partner with blue eyes? What about the probability of a randomly chosen male respondent with green eyes having a partner with blue eyes?

Parter blue eyes given self brown eyes:

```{r}
(19/204)/(54/204)


```

Partner blue eyes given self green eyes:

```{r}
(11/204)/(36/204)

```

(d) Does it appear that the eye colors of male respondents and their partners are independent?


Explain your reasoning

It does not.  Independence would dictate equal chances of having blue eye partners across males with different eye colors.  However it appears that have blue eye themselves effectively doubles the probability of having a partner with blue eyes.


###2.30

The table below shows the distribution of books on a bookcase based on whether they are nonfiction or fiction and hardcover or paperback.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/mike/Documents/R/win-library/3.5/DATA606/labs/Lab1/question2.30.PNG")

```


(a) Find the probability of drawing a hardcover book first then a paperback fiction book second when drawing without replacement.

P = 0.1849944

(b) Determine the probability of drawing a fiction book first and then a hardcover book second, when drawing without replacement.

P = 0.22430011

(c) Calculate the probability of the scenario in part (b), except this time complete the calculations under the scenario where the first book is placed back on the bookcase before randomly drawing the second book.

P = 0.2233795

(d) The final answers to parts (b) and (c) are very similar. Explain why this is the case.

Given the first draw was a fiction book, the chance the first draw was a hardcover was ~18%.  Therefore removing that book from the set (i.e. without replacement, question B) only led to a marginal decrease in the chance of drawing a hardcover on the second draw.

###2.38

An airline charges the following baggage fees: \$25 for the first bag and \$35 for the second. Suppose 54% of passengers have no checked luggage, 34% have one piece of checked luggage and 12% have two pieces. We suppose a negligible portion of people check more than two bags.

(a) Build a probability model, compute the average revenue per passenger, and compute the
corresponding standard deviation.


```{r}
table_names <- c("Bags", "Percent_Passengers","Revenue")
num_bags <- c(0,1,2)
percent_passengers <- c(0.54,0.34,0.12)
revenue <- c(0,25,60)

prob_table <- data.frame(num_bags, percent_passengers,revenue)
colnames(prob_table) <- table_names

prob_table

```



Revenue per passenger is:

$$0.54 * $0 + .34 * 25 + .12 * 60 = $15.7$$


Standard Deviation is:

```{r}
sigma <- sqrt((0 - 15.7)^2 * 0.54 + (25 - 15.7)^2 * 0.34 + (60-15.7)^2 * 0.12)

sigma

```



(b) About how much revenue should the airline expect for a flight of 120 passengers? With what
standard deviation? Note any assumptions you make and if you think they are justified.

Revenue from 120 passengers is:

120 * \$15.7 = \$1884

Standard Deviation is:

```{r}
variance <- (0 - 15.7)^2 * 0.54 + (25 - 15.7)^2 * 0.34 + (60-15.7)^2 * 0.12

total_standard_dev <- sqrt(120^2 * variance)

total_standard_dev

```

Assuming the passengers baggage choices are independent.

###2.44

The relative frequency table below displays the distribution of annual total personal income (in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars) for a representative sample of 96,420,486 Americans. These data come from the American Community Survey for 2005-2009.

This sample is comprised of 59% males and 41% females

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/mike/Documents/R/win-library/3.5/DATA606/labs/Lab1/question2.44.PNG")

```

(a) Describe the distribution of total personal income.

The distribution is symmetrical, with a mode of 35,000 - 49,999.

(b) What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than \$50,000 per year?

21.2% + 18.3% + 15.8% + 4.7% + 2.2% = 62.2%


(c) What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than \$50,000 per year and is female?

Note any assumptions you make.

Assuming men and women make equal amounts on average, then the answer will be roughly 41% of 62.2%:

```{r}
.41 * .622

```

25.5%

(d) The same data source indicates that 71.8% of females make less than \$50,000 per year.  Use this value to determine whether or not the assumption you made in part (c) is valid.

The assumption that women make the equal amounts of men was false.  A larger portion of women are in lower income brackets when compared with men.
